1. A measure for how friendly a group of people is. 2022-10-23
I think it's safe to assume that we are working with a clique,
that is, a connected subgraph of the overall social network.

Claim: The longest path in such a clique is a good measure for
how friendly a group is.

1.1 Such a path cannot be simple, as that leads to nonsensical results:
- Imagine a friend network that looks like this:
F1 - F2 - F3 - ... - F100 (a chain of friends, free of loops)
This kind of network would have the exact same friendliness measure as
a network of 100 friends where everyone was friends with each other
(like a complete graph with 100 nodes, K_100).

1.2 Therefore the path is non-simple.
Goal: Find the longest non-simple path in an undirected graph.

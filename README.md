In my third semester in University, I had to create an application with some social media
elements. The course was called MAP (Advanced Programming Methods), and some of the things
we learnt were Java, how to create GUIs, and some Design patterns.

This was, at the time, the longest-running project I had worked on, spanning most of the
semester.

This is what I made.
